# About TEDx Open Source

Sharing ideas about technology, enterainment and design; those are the three pillars that started TED off in the â€˜80s. We want to continue to build upon the philosophy; to share and spread knowledge, inspire and create new ideas (and things) to achieve greatness.

By looking into the open source community to leverage the power of great developers who in return want to show and share their development skills; to their peers and other thinkerers by contributing under the TEDx flag; We want to make this an awesome and powerful statement to show that an aligned decentralised effort can bring about great new things.

Developers all over the world can apply to participate!
